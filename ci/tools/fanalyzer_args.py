"""Write NUL-delimited directory and argv for one compile database entry.

Called by ci/tools/fanalyzer.sh, which needs the exact flags gcc got for a
translation unit so the analyser parses the same preprocessor branches the
build compiled. Kept as a file rather than an inline heredoc because a heredoc
body cannot be indented inside a YAML block scalar without ending the scalar --
the workflow that first carried this logic failed to parse as YAML at all.

Env: DB    path to compile_commands.json
     SRC   the .c file to look up

Prints nothing and exits 0 when the file has no entry; the caller treats that
as a finding, since an unanalysed TU is a coverage gap and not a clean result.
